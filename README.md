Overbuilt Resume
===

Overbuilt Resume is a responsive, single page resumÃ© theme for web developers and designers. Based on the `_s` starter theme and Foundation for Sites (F6) css framework, this theme is not meant to act as a parent theme but as a standalone. Included are section for your biography, work history, skillset and toolbox ( w/ratings ), and contact information.

Here are some of the other more interesting things you'll find:

* Easy to use class, `CPT`, for creating custom post types.
* Inline editing added via X-Editable for the Skillset and Toolbox Sections (custom classes can be found in `inc/classes/`).
* Portfolio custom post type for displaying your work.
* All information for the "About" section is located on your user profile.
* Default Theme modifications can be found in the `inc/theme_setup.php` file.

Getting Started
---------------

1. Upload the overbuilt_resume.zip file
2. Go to Appearance => Themes and select `Overbuilt Resume`



To Do List
---------------

A. The theme currently has Google Analytics hardcoded, I need to add a theme option for it instead.
B. The user_id to determine the profile to use is currently hardcoded. Need to move this to a theme option.
