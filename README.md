My Single Page Resume Wordpress Theme
===

My resume is a responsive, single page Wordpress theme for web developers and designers. Based on the `_s` starter theme and Foundation for Sites (F6), this theme is not meant to act as a parent theme but as a standalone. 

Here are some of the other more interesting things you'll find:

* Easy to use class, `CPT`, for creating custom post types.
* Inline editing added via X-Editable for the Skillset and Toolbox Sections (custom classes can be found in `inc/classes/`).
* Portfolio custom post type for displaying your work.
* All information for the "About" section is located on your user profile.
* Default Theme modifications can be found in the `inc/theme_setup.php` file.


Getting Started
---------------

1. Upload the wp_single_page_resume.zip file
2. Go to Appearance => Themes and select `WP Single Page Resume`



License
---------------

Use this theme however you like! If you make something cool or improve upon it, I'd love to get a link and check it out.
